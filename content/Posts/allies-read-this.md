A problem that has taken my interest of late is sexism in the tech industry. There is no doubt the problem exists. The solution isn't out of reach but it is hard. Very hard.

As a very privileged white male I knew enough not to dive in suggestion solutions. I've been listening to a lot of great people. Experts in this area that can offer a lot more than myself.

## So you want to be an ally

Julie Pagano has written a [great post](http://juliepagano.com/blog/2014/05/10/so-you-want-to-be-an-ally/) on how to be an ally. That is, someone not in the opressed minority that wants to see an end to the opression.

Please [read it](http://juliepagano.com/blog/2014/05/10/so-you-want-to-be-an-ally/). Go a head. I'll wait.

## Listening

To be honest I don't have much to add. I think being uncomfortable is a great start. You never learn anything in an echo chamber. If someone's comments on sexism start to make you uncomfortable maybe you shuold reflect on why that is.
