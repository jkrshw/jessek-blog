## Installing ssh server

    sudo apt-get install openssh-server

## Setting up ssh connections without requiring a password

1. Copy public key from local machine to remote machine

        scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub mythbox@c2:/tmp/jess.id_rsa.pub

2. Log in to remote machine and append public key to authorized_keys file

        ssh mythbox@c2
        cat /tmp/jess.id_rsa.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys

##Remove ssh key
If a server's IP address has changed, trying to connect via ssh will fail because the IP address stored against the server's key no longer matches.  If you're sure there is no man-in-the-middle attack in play, you can remove the offending key

    ssh-keygen -R <hostname>
